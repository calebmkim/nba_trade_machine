Installation Instructions: 
1) Use the CS 3110 virtual machine 

2) "opam install graphics" (since that is the only library that we used that we did not already download as part of the CS3110 class). "eval $(opam env)" and  "opam install user-setup" if/when it asks you to. 

3) run "make play" in the directory of the project (i.e in the directory of the folder that you just unzipped).
DISCLAIMER: The font is suuuuuper small (this is because the font that we originally were using did not work on the VM). We will work on this for the future. But the functionality still holds.

Note: if that doesn't work, try making an opam switch: 
1) "opam switch create demo ocaml-base-compiler.4.12.0" and 
run "eval $(opam env)" anytime it tells you to. 
2) run "opam install -y utop odoc ounit2 qcheck ocamlformat ocamlformat-rpc"
3)Run "opam install graphics" and "opam install yojson" 
4) "opam install user-setup" if it asks you to. 

Note 2: If that doesn't work, I guess you can try just running on your regular laptop to see if it works. 


Once you're running it, how to use it: 
1) When you see the list of NBA teams, click on any team: you can either "add team" to trade, or "examine roster". While examining roster, click on a player to look at his name (we will add more info later). To go back, just click the blank space. 
2) When you are satisfied with the teams currently involved in the trade click the red "finalize teams" button. Now, you will only see the teams you have picked to be involved in the trade. Now, you will be able to see the rosters, but this time, if you click a player's name, you will have the option of trading him. Create a trade, and then click, the red "execute trade" button. Now, you will see the team names, but this time the rosters have been altered.
